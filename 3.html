<p>He will look to maintain that run when he faces Crystal Palace, having scored four goals in his last four meetings with them.</p>
<p>The England captain holds the record for the best minutes-per-goal average on Boxing Day, among the players who have appeared in at least four such matches, netting every 54 minutes.</p>
